Titabe it is an entrepreneurship from cordoba, Argentina which is looking for expand its business via web.

This ecommerce started as my project of Full Stack Developer course.

The back-end was created on Node.js using many npm packages like Express, Multer, Sequelize, etc.

The data is stored in local SQL database.

The front-end started as a basic HTML - CSS but then it migrated to EJS which allows the use of JavaScript and Bootstrap was also added to improve the responsive looking of the site.
